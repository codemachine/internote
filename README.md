# Internote #

Persistent sticky notes for Firefox 3 or later. 

## Description ##

Internote allows you to create useful and private notes on webpages which will be there once you return.

With Internote, you can do many things. Move, resize, recolor, minimize, import, export, print, delete your notes ... choose the pages where a note appears ... or manage them all at once.

Internote3 includes new features such as minimized notes, the ability to specify which pages a note shows on, an improved manager and an improved look, as well as aiming to be more robust and easy to improve.

## Installing ##

The easiest way to install Internote is head over to the [Firefox addons site](http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/internote/) or the [Internote web site](http://internote.sourceforge.net).
